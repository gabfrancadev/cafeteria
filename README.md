# Daily Sales Tracker – Python CLI

This project is a command-line application developed to practice fundamental programming concepts in Python.

The main goal was to build a system capable of registering multiple customer orders, calculating totals, and generating a daily sales summary using loops and conditional logic.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3

## Project Features

- Register multiple customer orders
- Calculate total value per order
- Track total daily revenue
- Count total items sold
- Identify customers who purchased more than three items
- Determine the highest order value of the day
- Formatted financial output

## What I Learned

- Using `while` and `for` loops effectively
- Applying conditional statements for decision-making
- Working with accumulators and counters
- Handling user input safely
- Formatting numerical output in Python
- Structuring procedural programs clearly and logically
